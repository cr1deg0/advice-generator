## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I chose this project to practice getting data from an API and the handling of errors in this process. 

I decided to add a light/dark mode theme switch and also a typewriter text effect to learn new skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS Complete guide to Dark Mode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) - This helped me to understand the different options to implement a theme togler and also how to combine the user's color scheme preference and a theme toggler.
- [CSS-TRICKS How to scale SVG](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) - I was looking for a way to scale the svg based on the screen size, rather than using two different images as provided in the design. The solution, to define a viewBox attribute in the svg!
- [w3 schools Typing effect](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp) - Explains how to create the typing effect I've used for the advice.
